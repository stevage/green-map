Kunshan Culture and Art Center is an important cultural project in Kunshan with a total area of 119,000 square meters. The precinct also 
includes a public plaza that integrates the new icon building with the joining waterway and existing sports facilities. Central to this plaza is 
the constructed wetland system which has been integrated within contemporary landscape character of the plaza and functions as an 
ecological landscape that not only provides (vegetation) biodiversity that is usually lost in the highly urbanized development area but also 
forms a green infrastructure that delivers multiple benefits to the precinct on top of its aesthetic and landscape value.
