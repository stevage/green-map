Slow Movement Network
This map shows the proposed slow movement network in Kunshan West. This is not an extensive mapping but these early routes
 provide exemplars demonstrating the idea of creating a meaningful slow movement network and methodology as to how the routes 
could be generated. 
This network orientates itself primarily around the city’s waterways and provide a variety of additional amenities to the city, creating 
high quality public space for residents to enjoy. The proposed network incorporating the 6 themed routes abuts approximately 80% of 
the study site's waterways and shows a 500m wide catchment corridor reach or two minutes walk.
